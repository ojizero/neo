## What?

Those are my personal configurations for (Neo)Vim. They're meant to ease my work mostly, and set Vim as a cosy editor with some IDE features.

## Why?

I like Vim :grimacing: so I decided to move full time using it!

## Installation

### Install configs

To install it simply clone the repo and run `make setup`.

The repo must remain cloned somewhere in the system to work :grimacing:.

### Updating configs

Update the cloned repo, or run `make update`.

### Remove configs

Run `make remove` and remove the repo.

<!-- ## Configurations included-->

## Caveats

- This is still a work in progress, more things are being added as I need them, these configs are stable enough to get me through the day for now.
- The Makefile setup is only made for NeoVim so far, general setup changes will come soon :grimacing:.
